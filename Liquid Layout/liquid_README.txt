Question: Why you would use a liquid layout?
Answer: Liquid layouts are layouts in which size is not defined in fixed length but in percentages of the current web browser window's size (or viewport). Thus, they are very flexible and can change their size accordingly when the user resizes the browser window or change screen resolution. This maximizes the area for the content to be displayed in whatever screen resolution or device of the user. Therefore, liquid layouts are often used for web site components that need to get across a lot of information in as little space as possible such as the content component.
Note: The question asks for a liquid layout without any further specifications so I went ahead and created a very generic and simple two columns layout with HTML and CSS. Maybe because I do not have much experience in web design, I could not figure out how to use JavaScript in this case. I know that some websites use JavaScript to calculate the dimensions of the viewport and force the size of the layout components. However, since the requirements are generic, it does not make sense to me to use JavaScript.
